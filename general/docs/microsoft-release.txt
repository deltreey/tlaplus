TO MAKE Revert to HEAD WORK
  After doing revert to HEAD, Eclipse reverts the file but still marks it as
  changed.  To unmark it, open a Cygwin shell, cd to ~/git/tlaplus2, and perform the command

      git checkout FileName

  where FileName is the path to the file name Eclipse shows, which should be a copy
  of the file in the branch currently selected in Eclipse.
  
  
OBSOLETE TO START SVC-LAMPORT-7 AS A TESTBED
  https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/computer/svc/
  log in as lamport/g...
  Start the slave.
  
  Note: To set up a new machine to replace SVC-LAMPORT-7,
        must install Java jdk and add the environment variable JAVA_HOME 
        and set it to something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_26


TO PREPARE THE ZIP FILES FOR THE TOOLBOX RELEASE

Notes: 0. Run Ant on tlatools/src/customBuild.xml

       1. To get tlatools.jar file copied to the right place for the distributed version of TLC, 
          after running Ant, run "mvn install" in the directory
      
            C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria-workspace\tla2-inria\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.jnlp
            
       2. If maven doesn't produce a good build, try running `mvn clean' before
          running `mvn install'
          
       3. The file .../newtools/tla2-inria/pom.xml is not automatically updated
          by SVN inside Eclipse, and must be updated by running 'svn up pom.xml'
          in a Cygwin shell.  Running `svn up' in a Cygwin shell might not be a bad
          idea, because it seems to update some things that Eclipse doesn't.

Step 1: Get the right version numbers to appear:


-- In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone 
   plugin.xml : line 32 (the "aboutText" property), update date and version 
               and other stuff that appears in the Help/About window.  

-- standalone.product: 
    As of 24 Jun 2011, standalone.product has moved to:
    org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
     Branding tab: update date and version (This is used in Help > About and used to
        create zip file names.)
     Overview: update version.  (I don't know if this is used anywhere.)

-- In org.lamport.tla.toolbox/src/org/lamport/tla/toolbox/ui/view/ToolboxWelcomeView.java
   Update date and version

-- In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/pom.xml around line 73 change the archiveFileName
   XML tag to have the correct version number. This tag defines how the zip files will be named.
   Similarly, adapt the <deb> tag further down. 

-- In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/src/deb/control/control adapt the version tag.

-- In org.lamport.tla.toolbox.doc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF, update the version (major.minor.micro).
   But do _not_ replace the last (".qualifier") segment. It is automatically replaced by the build.

-- Also, the version number in the pom.xml file in the same directory (and only in the same 
   directory???) has to be made the same (but leave the "-SNAPSHOT" unchanged).  Note that 
   explicitly replacing ".qualifier" with e.g. ".f" breaks the build with:

"Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-packaging-plugin:0.14.0-SNAPSHOT:validate-version 
(default-validate-version) on project org.lamport.tla.toolbox.doc: OSGi version 1.4.3.f must have .qualifier qualifier for SNAPSHOT builds"

(If one absolutely has to set the ".qualifier" segment explicitly, do not forget to update 
the version (not parent version!) org.lamport.tla.toolbox.doc/pom.xml
correspondingly. It has to match the MANIFEST.MF version verbatim.  However, 3 levels of version numbers
are enough and we should abandon the .a, .b, ...)

OBSOLETE:
In toolbox.product.standalone/intro/root.xhtml: 
  update version information.

Step 2: Build the .zip files:
Method 1: 
Note: org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
       before June 2011 was named
   org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.standalone.product
   
  Go to the Overview tab of org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product   
  Synchronize and use Eclipse Product export wizard
  In the first menu, give
    Product Configuration: 
      Configuration:
        /org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product.product
      Root directory: toolbox
    Synchronization:
      Synchronize before exporting
    Destination:
      Archive file:
        c:\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k  or
        c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release\toolbox-i.j.k on svc-lamport-4
        
    Export Options
      Generate metadata repository
      Export for muliple platforms
      Allow for binary cycles in target platform
  In Cross-platform export menu, select
    linux (gtk/x86 & x86_64)
    macosx (cocoa/x86 & x86_64
    win32 (win32/x86 & x86_64)

 Hitting Finish then puts the zip files into:
     c:\users\lamport\tla\toolbox-release
 The repository/ directory in c:\users\lamport\tla\ contains the content for the update site (p2)

Method 2. Using Maven
 NOTE:  ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria has been changed to
      ~/tla/newtools/tla-workspace on SVC-LAMPORT-2 and to ~/tla/newtools/tla2-workspace
      on SVC-LAMPORT-1.
  Run svn update on  pom.xml in ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria. 
  Set the version number in ...product.product/pom.xml.
  (The target platforms to build for are specified in tla2-inria/pom.xml.  This file also specifies
   what version of the Eclipse libraries to build with.)
  In a Cygwin shell, 
   - cd to ~/tla/newtools/tla2-inria-workspace/tla2-inria
   - run:  mvn install
  This might fail because the right versions of things aren't installed.
    It it does, try running "mvn clean" first.
  Running "mvn install" runs tests, which could fail--especially if
     I'm using the machine while it's running the tests.  I should probably
     run mvn on a window that I'm not using, but mouse movements could
     probably still cause the tests to fail.  If I want to run the tests,
     I probably shouldn't do anything else at the same time.
  To not run the tests, instead run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
  To have it do the tests but continue if it fails, run
     mvn install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
    However, failure of a test seems capable of hanging up Maven.
  The .zip files are in
       C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla-workspace\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\target\products
  They also appear with weird names in:
       C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product\version-number-SNAPSHOT
       This will keep accumulating new versions.  To delete an old version, delete the
          C:\Users\lamport\.m2\repository\tlatoolbox\
       directory.

Method 3. Using tla.msr-inria.inria.fr
  - In browser, goto https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
  - login
  - before making a release, check that there are no problems by checking
    in all changes, and going to M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone
    IF THERE IS A FAILURE, click on the "default" button under "Configurations"
    (which will add "/os=master" to the URL), then
    click on the appropriate version, then click on "Console Output" (not "raw").
    The error may appear in red at the bottom.
  - to make a new release: click on the button to the right of
       Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone  
       This isn't released publicly until I do the release step, below
       
  - to get the release zip files, 
       * To get the last promoted (publicly available) release, go to: 
            - goto https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
            - click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone 
            - click on "Latest product zips" to get the Toolbox zips
              click on "TLA+ distribution zip" to get to the stand-alone 
                TLA tools release zip file, which is in tla.zip.
       * To get the last created (but not necessarily promoted) release, go to:
            https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlatoolbox/staged
              /products = toolbox zip files
              /dist = tools distribution
         an alternative is:
               https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/M-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/os=master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/org.lamport.tla.toolbox.product.product/target/
               * click on products
               * you can get the 6 Toolbox zip files from /products and tla.zip from /dist
     Another alternate way to get to the https://...target/ page:
      On https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build
       1. click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone 
       2. click on Latest product zips
      to get to the stand-alone TLA tools release zip file, in step 2
      click on "TLA+ distribution zip".  The release is in tla.zip.
  - To release this:
     Click on Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone (direct link https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/build/job/Release-HEAD-Toolbox.product.standalone/)
     Click on most recent build in build history.
     Click on Promotion Status.
     Click on Approve.
     
  Note: The Toolbox tries to update itself by looking for the files at  lamport.org/tlatoolbox/toolboxUpdate/.
        This is redirected to the right place by putting in my lamport.org/ top-level directory a file named .htaccess containing
        the line
                  Redirect /tlatoolbox http://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlatoolbox

TO PREPARE THE STAND-ALONE TLA TOOLS RELEASE ZIP FILE (IN 
Methods 1 and 2)
  Run the Ant default-release option.  This will put the release in
     C:\lamport\tla\newtools\tla2-inria\tlatools\dist\tla.zip

TO GENERATE THE RELEASE:
  In Feb 2013, the following became obsolete.  Perhaps I can do it
  by going to 
  
     https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/MSRrelease/Pages/default.aspx
     
  probably I will need help.  In Feb 2013, I was helped by 
  John Ransier (Aditi Technologies Private LTD) <v-jorans@microsoft.com>.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5.2 - 21 December 2015
  - Quick access dialog to make models easily accessible to users (Ctrl+Shift-A). Additionally shows a spec's modules and (optionally) closed specs.
  - Upon spec safe, automatically keep a file revision/history. Let users restore revision from history view.
  - Do not offer to use built-in PDF viewer on Mac OS X. It is fundamentally broken and Mac's PDF viewer is more powerful anyway.
  - Parse and size status line item's height too small.
  - Limit the trace length to a fixed number of 1000 states by default. User can easily load more by clicking "Load more" in trace explorer.
  - Show corresponding action for "back-to-state" cycle marker upon double click.
  - Remove any symmetry definition when model is run in TraceExplorer.
  - Allow users to add free-form comments to their models.
  - Show warnings when modelchecking terminated with unexplored states left.
  - Result page better indicates liveness checking stage (final vs. run on incomplete liveness graph).
  - Stop NumberFormatException in "per minute" statistics.
  - Fix bug where Toolbox reports a bogus invariant violation.
  - Show Modules (files in spec dir) and Models as children of the root specification in the SpecExplorer. Group both under a virtual "modules" and "models" tree item.
  - Show progress when opening a model from an existing log file. Supports cancellation if log file is large.
  - Toolbox hangs on large TLC outputs during model checking and at startup. Now several orders of magnitude faster.
  - Only reflect address part instead of full URL back on distributed TLC's setup webpage. (SECURITY)
  - Allow only one Toolbox instance to be running.
  - Open Module can open modules from foreign specs.
  - Upgrade to Eclipse Foundation 4.5.
  - Run liveness checking based on runtime ratio between safety and liveness checking.
  - Add -userFile parameter to redirect Print/PrintT/... output to dedicated file instead of sysout.
  - Show time it took to model check and to check liveness.
  - Simulator (and DFIDChecker) now support TLCSet/TLCGet.
  - Distributed TLC does not support TLCGet/TLCSet. Prints a warning upon startup.
  - The ordering of records in TLC.Print and PrintT statement outputs can be wrong.
  - Report Java assertion violations as such. Don't blame it on the user's spec or model.
  - Do not throw a NullPointerException on action-less spec when coverage requested.
  - Incorrect cmdline parameters cause NullPointerException.
  - Race condition when printing the trace of an invariant violation.
  - Delay adding successor states *after* corresponding invariants and implied actions have been checked. Previously, the early addition could potentially lead to multiple invariant/implied action violations being reported simultaneously iff TLC uses multiple workers (i.e. worker 1 adds a successor to the StateQueue *before* checking the invariants. Worker 2 would explore this state and find a invariant violation concurrently with worker 1).
  - TLC never deletes old states from state queue causing the disk to fill up.
  - Fixed minor PlusCal translator bug.
  - Application Bundle packaging on Mac (Existing installations
    have to be manually updated).
  - Ended support for 32 bit Toolbox releases on Mac OSX.
Version 1.5.1 - 1 June 2015
  - Fix intermittent "Fingerprint is already on disk" TLC crash. 
  - Fix conditions in state queue that can deadlock TLC.
  - Fix NullPointer bug during distributed TLC startup when
    action or model constraints are defined.

  - Fixes bug in TLC that caused infinite looping if a recursively
    defined operator is used as an operator argument in its own
    definition.

Version 1.4.8 - 25 February 2014
  - Made module names case sensitive, so they must exactly match
    the name of the file containing them.
  - Disallowed <*> and <+> in names of named proof steps. 
  - Fixed bug which caused GotoDeclaration command not to work
    for a symbol inside a labeled expression.
